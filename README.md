# What is Land of Heroes?
Land of Heroes is a work in progress Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game ("MMORPG") that runs in the browser using the Phaser JavaScript engine to run on browsers on both desktop computers and mobile devices and is cross-compatible, and is a solo project started in 2018. NodeJS is used as the server, and MongoDB as the database.

The purpose of this project was to try a new style of programming for the client and server, keeping it as clean and modulized as possible. Much of the code is still being cleaned and revised.

This project includes a client and server. The server uses MongoDB as the database, which holds user account information.
